# Apache OpenWhisk on OpenShift

Apache OpenWhisk allows chaining of actions.  We will now create a simple sequence of actions which will split, convert to uppercase, and
 sort a comma separated string.  To highlight the flexibility of OpenWhisk, we will implement each step in a different language and 
 seamlessly chain them together to construct the overall process.
