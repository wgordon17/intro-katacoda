# Using Rules & Triggers with OpenShift Cloud Functions

In this scenario, you will deploy a simple nodejs timestamp function on the OpenShift Cloud Functions FaaS platform.
You will then setup activation polling to show when the timestamp function is executed.  After that, you will 
create a Rule and a Trigger to demonstrate how to use those features.

**Currently, the setup of OpenWhisk takes up to 2.5 minutes.  This setup was started when you started this scenario.
It is recommended that you come back in 2.5 minutes to proceed with the first step in this scenario.**
