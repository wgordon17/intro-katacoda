## Congratulations

In this scenario you learned how to:

* Write a simple timestamp function and deploy it.
* Poll the activation logging.
* Create a Trigger using the cron parameter of Alarm package feed.
* Create a Rule tied to the Trigger and verify the execution of the function

Please take sometime to play with other related scenarios that are available to get yourself familiarized with various
serverless concepts on OpenShift Cloud Functions. Good Luck!
