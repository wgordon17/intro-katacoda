## What is Fuse

Red Hat Fuse enables developers to take an Agile Integration approach when developing solutions. By building and composing microservices, Fuse allows distributed systems deployments and a focus on scaling of services and people.

Having this hybrid capability is important as demand grows for scalable cloud native microservice APIs. To simplify the development Fuse components offer a choice of three runtimes:



* As a standalone Java application (SpringBoot)
* As a service in Apache Karaf (OSGi)
* As a service in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JavaEE)
