With the project space now available, let's create the broker instance.

To allow ingress traffic to the messaging destinations, configure the required secrets with the following command:

``oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates/ose-v1.4.5/secrets/amq-app-secret.json -n messaging``{{execute}}

Add cluster capabilities to service account

``oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:messaging:amq-service-account``{{execute}}

Create a new app using the OpenShift command:

``oc new-app amq-broker-71-basic -p AMQ_PROTOCOL=openwire,amqp,stomp,mqtt -p AMQ_USER=amquser -p AMQ_PASSWORD=amqpassword``{{execute}}

This command will create a broker instance with the ``OpenWire`` and ``AMQP`` protocols enabled.

You should see the output:

```
--> Deploying template "openshift/amq63-basic" to project messaging

     Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3 (Ephemeral, no SSL)
     ---------
     Application template for JBoss A-MQ brokers. These can be deployed as standalone or in a mesh. This template doesn't feature SSL support.

     A new messaging service has been created in your project. It will handle the protocol(s) "openwire,amqp,stomp". Theusername/password for accessing the service is amqUser/amqPassword.

     * With parameters:
        * Application Name=broker
        * A-MQ Protocols=openwire,amqp,stomp
        * Queues=myqueue
        * Topics=mytopic
        * A-MQ Serializable Packages=
        * A-MQ Username=amqUser
        * A-MQ Password=amqPassword
        * A-MQ Mesh Discovery Type=kube
        * A-MQ Storage Limit=100 gb
        * ImageStream Namespace=openshift

--> Creating resources ...
    service "broker-amq-amqp" created
    service "broker-amq-mqtt" created
    service "broker-amq-stomp" created
    service "broker-amq-tcp" created
    deploymentconfig "broker-amq" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/broker-amq-amqp'
     'oc expose svc/broker-amq-mqtt'
     'oc expose svc/broker-amq-stomp'
     'oc expose svc/broker-amq-tcp'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

When the provisioning of the broker finishes, you will be set to start using the service. In the next step you will deploy a simple messging application.
