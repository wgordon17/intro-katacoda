In this self paced tutorial you will learn how to use the OpenShift Container Platform to build and deploy applications using the `odo` developer command line tool.

## Let's get started

If you are not familiar with the OpenShift Container Platform, it's worth taking a few minutes to understand the basics of the platform as well as the environment that you will be using for this self-paced tutorial.

The goal of OpenShift is to provide a great experience for both Developers and System Administrators to develop, deploy, and run containerized applications.  Developers love OpenShift because it enables them to take advantage of both containerized applications and orchestration without having to know the details. Developers are free to focus on application code and user's needs.

OpenShift is a complete platform that incorporates several upstream projects while also providing additional features and functionality to make those upstream projects easier to use. OpenShift is built on containers and orchestration. For the container side of the house, the platform packages applications in container images based on the [Open Container Initiative (OCI) Image Specification][oci-img]. For the orchestration side, Red Hat's OpenShift team contributes intensively to the upstream Kubernetes project. OpenShift specifies a set of extended Kubernetes objects, such as Routes and Deployment Configs, that tie fundamental orchestration abstractions together in ways that are simple for developers to understand and manipulate.

In this tutorial we focus on the command line interface using the `odo` tool, however, there are other methods to communicate with OpenShift.

### Regular Command Line Interface

The regular command line tool that we will be using as part of this training is called *oc*.  *Oc* is written in the Go programming language and is a single executable provided for Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

### Developer-Centric Command Line Interface

This lesson introduces an additional command line tool, *odo*, that helps developers model applications in familiar ways while deploying them on OpenShift.

### Web Console

OpenShift also provides a feature-rich Web Console with a friendly graphical interface for deploying and managing applications on the cluster.

### REST API

Both the command line tool and the web console communicate with OpenShift through the same REST API. Having a robust API allows users to create their own scripts and other automation depending on their specific requirements.  For detailed information about the REST API, check out the official documentation at: https://docs.openshift.org/latest/rest_api/index.html

During this training, you will be using both the command line tools and the web console.  However, it should be noted that there are plugins for several integrated development environments as well.  For example, to use OpenShift from the Eclipse IDE, you could use the official [https://tools.jboss.org/features/openshift.html](JBoss Tools) plugin.

### The Environment

During this training course you will be using a hosted OpenShift environment that is created just for you.  This environment is not shared with other users of the system.  Because each user taking this training has their own environment, we had to make some concessions to ensure the overall platform is stable and used only for this training.  For that reason, your environment will only be active for a one hour period.  Keep this in mind before embarking on getting through the content.  Each time you start this training, a new environment will be created on the fly.

The OpenShift environment created for you is running the latest version of the open source OpenShift Origin. This deployment is a self-contained environment that provides everything you need to be successful learning the platform. This includes a command line environment, the OpenShift web console, public URLs, and sample applications.
